# Bayesian_ns

The project is to get a posterior estimation code for various parameters describing a post merger signal of NS Ns coalesence. 

To start with the signal is assumed to be a damped sinusoidal and the program likelihood.py attempts to compute the distribution of the likelihood across the parameter space.

It does that in 3 ways:
1) tau vs freq
2) freq vs freq
3) amp vs freq
